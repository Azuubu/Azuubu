- 👋 Hi, I’m @Azuubu
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development when it comes to programming, but I have many more various hobbies apart from it such as sports, games, etc :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react.js. I'm already quite proficient with the core languages of web development and I want to further expand my expertise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code problems related to web stack as well as any other involving tasks. I really want to get better at it with each passing day.
- 📫 If u want to reach me just send me an email.
